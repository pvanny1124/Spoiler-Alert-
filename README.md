# Spoiler-Alert-
In this project, we use jQuery to initially hide two spoilers from "Star Wars" with buttons, and then reveal them when a user clicks on these buttons.

In this example, we take a look at basic jQuery syntax and examine how to select DOM elements and use methods such as prev(), show(), hide(), remove(), and append() on these methods.
